## Instructions for Attempting the Question
This task consists of 5 parts, each focusing on a basic JavaScript concept like array manipulation and function creation. The goal is to implement the provided functions and verify the output by running test cases. Below are the detailed instructions for completing this task:


### Clone the Boilerplate Repository
- Clone the repository: First, download the boilerplate code. You can do this by cloning the repository to your local system. The repository contains the necessary files like README.md and app.js for getting started.

- Navigate to the project directory: After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder where the app.js and README.md files are located.

- Open the README.md/ instructions.md file for further instructions and explanations of the task.
- Open app.js where you will implement the functions.

## App.js
- Open app.js: In app.js, you'll find the function definitions where you need to implement the code. For each task, you will need to:

**Write the required function.**
- Use appropriate JavaScript methods or operators (like map(), push(), pop(), etc.) to solve the problem.
**Implement the Functions**
- You need to complete the following 5 functions. Read each task carefully, understand the requirements, and then proceed to write the necessary code in app.js.


## Tasks
**Task 1:**  Filter Numbers Greater Than 3 (Using filter() method)
**Objective:**  Implement the filterNumbers function that filters out all numbers from the numbers array greater than 3.

**Task 2:**  Implement the filterNumbers function that filters out all numbers from the numbers array greater than 3.
**Objective:**  : Implement the addElementToStart function that adds the number 0 to the beginning of the numbers array and returns the updated array.

**Task 3:**  Find the Longest Word (Using reduce() method)
**Objective:**   Implement the findLongestWord function to find the longest word in the words array using the reduce() method.


**Task 4:**  Remove Elements from the Array (Using splice() method)
**Objective:**  Implement the removeElements function that uses the splice() method to remove the second and third elements from the letters array and return the updated array.

**Task 5:** Find the Index of a Word (Using indexOf() method)
**Objective:** Implement the findWordIndex function to find the index of the word 'cat' in the words array using the indexOf() method.



## Verify the Functions Against Test Cases

- The repository includes Jasmine test cases to verify your implementation.
- You can run the test cases by starting a live server.
- The test cases are already written for each function. Make sure all test cases pass successfully before proceeding.


## Save, Compress, and Upload the Files
- After implementing the functions and verifying them with the test cases, save your changes to the files.
- Once youâ€™re satisfied with your implementation, compress the entire project folder into a ZIP file.
- Upload the ZIP file to the provided submission platform.

## Additional Notes:
 - This task is compulsory, so ensure all functions are correctly implemented and tested.
 - Each task is worth 2 marks, for a total of 10 marks.
 - Submit the ZIP file of the project folder, containing the app.js, README.md, and any other necessary files (like test files or configuration files) required to run the tests.


 *Please ensure to save the changes before compression*

 *All the very best*
